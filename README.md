After obfuscating the java files, these will be converted to .jsonl files, with the following layout:

```jsonl
{
    "prompt": "public class A { void b() { int x = 10; System.out.println(x); } }",
    "response": "public class Calculator { void printValue() { int value = 10; System.out.println(value); } }"
}
```

In case you make use of the method2test, there is also an another tool to help extract the java methods.
This tool builds on the research of:

```
De Keersmaeker, A. (2023). Enhancing Test Code Understandability with Machine Learning-Based Identifier Naming.
Masterâ€™s Thesis, University of Antwerp.
```

It simply extracts the methods from the txt file and outputs it in a seperate directory. It does make use of some external methods, you can simply use poetry to install these packages if not done manually.
